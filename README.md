# Clothing System 3D

This is an asset project for Unity 3D that allows customization of a characters appearance.

Read the **Documentation** to learn how to use the asset.

**Unity version and language**

The actual version of Unity used in this project is 5.4.1f1, and the language used is C#

**3D Models**

All the 3d models used here are in FBX format in the Assets folder. The original files in Blender (2.77) format can be found in the Source Models Files folder.

**Important Notes**

All data used by the asset is stored in a database. In the actual version, the database is a set of XML files.
Implementations to use another way to store the necessary data can be easily implemented, check the Documentation for more info.

New features can be implemented in future, like a system to control hair.

**Final Words**

My two neurons needs tons of coffee to produce things like this one. Help me to feed them ;)
